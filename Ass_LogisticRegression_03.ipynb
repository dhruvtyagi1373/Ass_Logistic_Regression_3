    "- It provides a reliable architecture. Using multiple CSPs creates redundancies that minimize the risk of a single point of failure. It reduces the chances that a single service failure will make the entire organization go offline.\n",
    "- It provides freedom of choice. Multi-cloud models allow companies to choose the best CSP based on contracts, payment flexibility, and customizable capacity. This is especially important as business requirements change, allowing companies to allocate resources accordingly.\n",
